# Online Graduation Survey

## Introduction

The **Online Graduation Survey** portal is developed to streamline and automate the process of collecting feedback from students in educational institutions. Traditionally, gathering and maintaining feedback has been a time-consuming, effort-intensive, and paperwork-heavy task. This portal eliminates the need for physical record-keeping and manual feedback evaluation.

### Key Features:
- Reduces the burden of manually maintaining and assessing feedback forms.
- Eliminates the need for physical presence of both the admin and the students.
- Automated report generation for feedback, significantly reducing processing time.
- Data is stored securely and can be accessed and manipulated easily, with long-term retention.
  
The goal of this project is to replace the existing manual feedback system with a digital solution that improves efficiency, reliability, and user experience. The web-based survey form allows students to provide feedback quickly and easily, while departments can access comprehensive feedback reports with minimal effort.

## Objectives
- **Automation**: To transition from a manual feedback process to a fully computerized system.
- **Efficiency**: To reduce the time and effort involved in both giving and assessing feedback.
- **Data Management**: To ensure that feedback is stored securely and can be accessed and analyzed easily over time.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: SQLite (or other database systems as required)
